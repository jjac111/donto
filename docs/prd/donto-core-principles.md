# Donto â€” Core Product Principles

These principles guide every product and UX decision for Donto. They are non-negotiable guardrails for MVP and beyond.

## 1) Ease of access, ease of use
- Every flow should be obvious and frictionless. Day-one users should be productive without training.
- Golden paths must be fast for the most common tasks (patient creation, appointment booking, note entry).

## 2) Great data visibility
- Users can quickly search and reach any relevant record from anywhere.
- Provide lightweight global search and context-aware quick actions.

## 3) Fewer clicks, faster work
- Optimize for minimal interactions. Common tasks should be accomplishable in a few clicks.
- Prefer inline actions and keyboard shortcuts over deep navigation.

## 4) Modern layouts, low visual noise
- Prioritize essential information; secondary details stay accessible but unobtrusive.
- Consistent visual hierarchy and spacing; readable typography; predictable components.
- Mobile and desktop friendly. Responsive first.

## 5) Zero tolerance for user frustration
- Proactively prevent foot-guns. Validate early, confirm destructive actions, and provide clear undo paths when feasible.
- Error states are specific, actionable, and helpful. Empty states guide users to next steps.

## How we apply these
- Design-first: prototype critical flows before building.
- Measure: track time-to-task and click counts for top flows; iterate.
- International-first: Spanish by default; all strings translatable.
- Accessibility: sensible defaults, color contrast, keyboard navigation.
