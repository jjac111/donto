## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Odontogram Complexity**: Start with basic implementation, iterate based on user feedback
2. **Performance Requirements**: Monitor database queries early, optimize as needed
3. **Email Delivery**: Test with multiple providers, have fallback options
4. **User Adoption**: Focus on core workflows first, add features based on usage

### Contingency Plans

- **Scope Reduction**: If behind schedule, prioritize patient management and basic scheduling
- **Technical Issues**: Have backup plans for email (SMTP fallback) and deployment (alternative hosting)
- **User Feedback**: Build feedback collection early, be ready to pivot features

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics

- Patient search: ≤200ms P95
- Appointment creation: ≤30 seconds total
- Patient registration: ≤60 seconds total
- Uptime: ≥99.5% during business hours

### User Metrics

- 3+ active clinics using core flows for 2+ weeks
- Zero data loss incidents
- Positive user feedback on core workflows

## Resource Requirements

### Development

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js development
- **Backend**: Supabase/PostgreSQL optimization
- **DevOps**: Vercel + Supabase deployment
- **Testing**: Manual testing + automated tests

### External Services

- **Supabase Cloud**: Database hosting
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting
- **Resend**: Email delivery
- **Domain**: Production domain registration
